In this section we focus on creating assemblies using the Flye and hifiasm assemblers.

## Subsampled read sets
Creating a de novo assembly is one of the most compute intensive tasks in bioinformatics. Small genomes, like bacterial genomes, can be done on a laptop, but in most cases you need much more memory and CPU-power. That is the reason why for this workshop we focus on a ~2.5M region of a plant genome. However, assembly can still be a challenging task for your computer. Hence there are sub-sampled read sets available, containing 30% of the reads. You can make this set bigger of smaller by using:
~~~
{{site.vm_prompt}}seqtk sample hifi_reads.fastq 0.1 > hifi_sub.reads.fastq
~~~
{: .bash}

## Long read assemblies

 
> ## Flye 
> We will start with Flye assemblies based on the PacBio and Nanopore data. When there are enough resources available, please create assemblies of both the full read set, as well as the subsampled read set (so four assemblies in total).

> The output folder contains a log file which shows progress, but is also very handy for inspection when everything is done. 
> Which steps does flye take and what do they mean?
> ## Hifiasm
> Hifiasm is designed for assembling HiFi data. And because of the high quality of HiFi reads, it is very good in splitting up haplotypes. 
> For this workshop we also have high quality Nanopore data, so we will give this also a try.

## Getting a fasta-file
Hifiasm generates a .gfa file, which can be converted into a fasta file using, for example, awk:
~~~
{{site.vm_prompt}}awk '/^S/{print ">"$2"\n"$3}' hifiasm.asm.bp.p_ctg.gfa | fold > hifiasm.asm.bp.p_ctg.fa
~~~
{: .bash}
